# Krunky [Unmaintained]
### Developed by @ickerio and @JellyAlex

For a while myself and @JellyAlex have stopped actively working on the bot. Since it was released Krunker.io has changed many things internally breaking the bot in many ways. Recently, Sidney, the creator of Krunker.io released an official Krunker bot, [Kbot](https://t1p.de/kbot). Due to these reasons Krunky Bot will be shutting down at the end of the month. If you enjoyed Krunky's services, please don't hessitate to use Kbot which effectively does the same as Krunky.

Since the bot is going offline, we've decieded to open source the code to help others in their own endevour to create awesome discord bots! This project took us roughly three weeks in our holidays working a couple hours a day. We always planned on upgrading it and continuing to maintain it but exams quickly got in the way. At *time of death* Krunky had reached 18,931 discord users spanning 455 servers, which is far more than we'd ever expected. Frankly, I expected this project to be lost in the labrinth of generic discord bots on discord bot listing sites. Its awesome to have a project we worked really hard on appreciated like this by the community.

If you're unsure what this bot even was, have a look at our [old website](https://ickerio.github.io/Krunky-Docs/)

THANKYOU!
